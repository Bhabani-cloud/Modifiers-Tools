### Toggle Auto Perspective
This button lets you toggle on/off Auto Perspective Mode.
When you press the shortcut key or hit the button 'Toggle Auto Perspective' button on N-panel, Then it will allow you to lock the perspective.
Basically it locks the Perspective Mode and doesnot switch to the orthographic Mode while you are in Perspective mode. If you only want the orthographic Mode to appear then you have to hit "Numpad 5" to change to Orthoraphic Mode and this one too would not change to Perspective Mode.
Inorder to disable this function, You can toggle on/of the "Toggle Auto Perspective" button from N-panel. 

Shortcut key - CTRL + SHIFT + 2

### Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse
When working with multiple objects that share the same modifiers, you may need to hold the Alt key to apply an effect across all selected objects. However, if you are operating in Emulate 3 Mouse Button mode, this functionality may not be immediately accessible. In such cases, you can quickly toggle the setting using the designated keyboard shortcut or manually adjust it from the  Npanel.

So I added this button with shortcut keys -  **CTRL + SHIFT + 1** - 
This lets you toggle on or off **Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse** without going into preferences and switching repeatedly.

Simply go to the Sidepanel > Modifier tools

Either you can click on the Button or hold the shortcut key.

### Toggle Modifier + Shading
This lets you smooth out shading while you are in subdivision mode and flat out when not in subdivision mode.

**Caution:** This only works when you've added a subdivision modifier on an object.

**Bonus:** You can add a shortcut key to this button by right-clicking assign shortcut. I have added **SHIFT + ALT + R**.
