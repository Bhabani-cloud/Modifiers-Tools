# Modifiers-Tools (Blender 4.4.0)
This Addon is specifically for drawing pad/tablet users. (Mouse Users can still use this.)

### Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse
Some keys don't work while you switch to Emulate 3 Mouse Button in the preferences.
For example, holding Alt keys in the modifiers tab to apply the effect to all selected objects does not work while you turn on **Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse** in the preferences.

So I added this button with shortcut keys -  **CTRL + SHIFT + 1** - 
This lets you toggle on or off **Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse** without going into preferences and switching repeatedly.

Simply go to the Sidepanel > Modifier tools

Either you can click on the Button or hold the shortcut key.

When working with multiple objects that share the same modifiers, you may need to hold the Alt key to apply an effect across all selected objects. However, if you are operating in Emulate 3 Mouse Button mode, this functionality may not be immediately accessible. In such cases, you can quickly toggle the setting using the designated keyboard shortcut or manually adjust it from the  Npanel.
