### Toggle Auto Perspective
This button lets you toggle on/off Auto Perspective Mode.
When you press the shortcut key or hit the button 'Toggle Auto Perspective' button on N-panel, Then it will allow you to lock the perspective.
Basically it locks the Perspective Mode and doesnot switch to the orthographic Mode while you are in Perspective mode. If you only want the orthographic Mode to appear then you have to hit "Numpad 5" to change to Orthoraphic Mode and this one too would not change to Perspective Mode.

In order to disable this function, You can toggle on/of the "Toggle Auto Perspective" button from N-panel. 

Shortcut key - CTRL + SHIFT + 2

### Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse
When working with multiple objects that share the same modifiers, you may need to hold the Alt key to apply an effect across all selected objects. However, if you are operating in Emulate 3 Mouse Button mode, this functionality may not be immediately accessible. In such cases, you can quickly toggle the setting using the designated keyboard shortcut or manually adjust it from the  Npanel.

So I added this button with shortcut keys -  **CTRL + SHIFT + 1** - 
This lets you toggle on or off **Toggle Emulate 3 Mouse Button Mouse** without going into preferences and switching repeatedly.

Simply go to the Sidepanel > Modifier tools

Either you can click on the Button or hold the shortcut key.

**Update v3_3:** Sometimes the Shortcut Key does not work when I restart Blender, so I had to re-enable the addon to work.
I fixed this by adding the force restart addon. So whenever I open up my Blender file, it forcibly re-enables itself. And you don't have to go over and over again inside the preferences to re-enable this addon. (I gave a warning guidance: "If Emulate 3 Button fails at startup, open Preferences once." and re-enable the addon by the user. Although I fixed this.) 

### Toggle Modifier + Shading
This lets you smooth out shading while you are in subdivision mode and flat out when not in subdivision mode.

**Caution:** This only works when you've added a subdivision modifier on an object.

**Bonus:** You can add a shortcut key to this button by right-clicking and assigning a shortcut. I have added **SHIFT + ALT + R**.



### Gizmo Size
This lets you resize the Gizmo Sizes as per the user's needs.
Slide the numbers or type in the numbers, or you can hold down "Shift + F" key to resize the gizmo and release it.

To reset the size, you have to right-click on the number and "Reset to Default Value".

Shortcut Key - Shift + F
